  <h2 class="pb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Howdy!</h2>
  <p class="mb-8 text-lg">
    My name is Alan, and I am currently working on various PKI services at
    Keytos.
    <br class="mb-4" />
    I am passionate about computer security and privacy. I have previously contributed
    to software-supply-chain security (SSCS) projects and am currently learning about
    novel privacy-enhancing technologies.
    <br class="mb-4" />
    In December 2023, I obtained a degree in Computer Engineering with the Highest
    Distinction from Purdue University. At Purdue, I worked on SSCS under Prof. Santiago
    Torres-Arias and was also, at one point, the President of Autonomous Motorsports
    Purdue.
    <br class="mb-4" />
    Starting in the Fall of 2025, I will work towards a PhD at CISPA under the guidance
    of Wouter Lueks and Sajin Sasy, beginning with a Master's at Saarland University.
