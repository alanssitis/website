    <p>
      I am a Master's student at Saarland University under the support of
      <a
        class="underline hover:decoration-2"
        href="https://cispa.de/en/career/excellence-program"
        >CISPA's Excellence Program for Master's Students</a
      > co-advised by
      <a class="underline hover:decoration-2" href="https://wouterlueks.nl/"
        >Wouter Lueks</a
      > and
      <a class="underline hover:decoration-2" href="https://ssasy.github.io/"
        >Sajin Sasy</a
      >. I plan to stay at CISPA later on as a PhD candidate.

      I seek to develop new techniques and build practical solutions to problems
      that require security and privacy guarantees where existing solutions do
      not suffice.

      In December 2023, I earned a degree in Computer Engineering with the
      Highest Distinction from Purdue University. There, I worked on
      software-supply-chain security projects under the guidance of
      <a class="underline hover:decoration-2" href="https://badhomb.re/"
        >Santiago Torres-Arias</a
      > and was also, at one point, the President of
      <a
        class="underline hover:decoration-2"
        href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/AMP/"
        >Autonomous Motorsports Purdue</a
      >.
    </p><p>
      Prior to rejoining academia, I was a software engineer at <a
        class="underline hover:decoration-2"
        href="https://www.keytos.io/">Keytos</a
      >, a startup offering various in-house PKI-as-a-Service products, where I
      built EZRADIUS, EZCMS, and maintained other services. I have also
      previously interned at Google on two occasions during my studies at
      Purdue.
