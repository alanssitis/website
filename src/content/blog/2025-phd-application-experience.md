With this essay, I hope to share my experience applying for PhD programs. If
you are reading this, you are probably an undergraduate student trying to
navigate the rather confusing world of PhD applications. I will outline what
I learned after applying in two PhD cycles, how I approached them each time,
what was the outcome each cycle, and my decision.

With regards to the application process, I will mostly be writing about things
that are not obvious, or things that I wished I had known. Namely, that an
application has to be pointed at a specific direction, and that you'd need to
spend time on the statement of purpose.

Note that each and every individual's path is unique, and what worked for me
will probably not work for others.

# Background

In order for you to understand my experiences through PhD applications, it
will help if you knew a bit more about my background. I recognize that I come
from great privilege of being able to pursue an undergraduate degree outside
of my country of nationality, but I made sure that I made the most of it and
worked as hard as I could.

I graduated with Highest Distinction from Purdue University majoring in
Computer Engineering, so I did pretty well in my classes. However, I definitely
spent more time doing other things. I was very involved with a club building
an autonomous go-kart (Autonomous Motorsports Purdue), contributed to software
supply-chain projects under the guidance of Santiago Torres-Arias (I guess my
only research-y experience really), and also worked as an undergraduate
teaching assistant and tutor for the School of Engineering. I also spent a lot
of time going to Purdue football games and Purdue basketball games, as well
as going out with my friends. In my opinion, it's important to have fun in
your studies, it keeps you sane. I would not have been able to work as hard as
I did if I did not find the things I did as fun.

Since my first encounter working with Santiago, I have always been interested
in doing research as a career. However, I had a few things that kept me from
fully considering it. Therefore, I was mostly optimizing to land a job in
industry, tailored my experiences and networking for that. I landed two
internships with Google and received a full-time offer from them, but decided
to give the startup experience a go and joined Keytos. In my last semester at
Purdue (Fall 2023) I hastily sent out applications in case I did not like
industry, this ended with a dud. In the following year, I was very happy with
my situation then, but had itchings to do research and gave it a second go in
case I wanted to go back to academia.

# The First Approach

Honestly, my first approach was never going to net a positive result. I came
in with very limited direction on what I wanted to do, and with whom I
wanted to work with. Therefore, my applications were boiler-plate
and revisiting the material I submitted then makes me cringe. The biggest red
flag I had was definitely my personal statement, it was very generic and did
not talk about what I was passionate about, nor did it really convey what I
wanted to do with a PhD. I genuinely just wrote one whole statement and swapped
out one paragraph without making significant modifications for each school. I
would say that my body of work wasn't what held me back, and instead, it was
my lack of passion for research in my personal statement.

Due to my lack of direction, I decided to apply to many schools with little
knowledge nor understanding of who I wanted to work with. This also
contributed to my decision to do a very boiler-plate-y personal statement for
all my applications.

The above was a small exerp on what _NOT_ to do when you apply for PhD programs.

## Failure

Back then, I was surprised when I heard back from nobody. Even though I knew I
did not put much effort into the application packages, it was dissapointing to
not have that second option if I wanted to pursue research. In hindsight, it
should not have surprised me, but oh well, that's how it goes sometimes.

# The Second Approach

Earlier in the year, after not hearing back from other schools, I had commited
to giving myself one more attempt at applying to PhD programs. The second
time around, I had one more year of experience of life under my belt. My time
at Keytos, where I was building PKI-as-a-Service products, was very
constructive. I learned a lot about how computer security was seen
in the real world. I was also very content with the trajectory of Keytos and
saw myself staying there long term.

Therefore, I narrowed down my vision for a PhD to something I knew I could
only do in academia. I looked for professors and researchers that were doing
the type of work that could compell me to leave Keytos, and this got me to
look for groups doing working on practical privacy. I ended up with a
significantlys maller list of schools and research centers I'd apply to, a
fraction of the first time, and also spent significantly more time in my
application packages, namely the statements of purpose. Most of my background
and recommendation letter-writers stayed the same.

## Results

This time, I applied to a total of eight programs, four in the US, and four in
Europe. I was invited to interview with four
programs and was admitted to all four of them. In all applications, I
highlighted my interest in working on privacy, but since most of my background
was in software supply-chain security, a lot of the people I talked to or
interviewed with, did more work in secure systems. I would also add that all
of my interactions with the professors I've met throughout my application
process were very positive and constructive. I'd go out on a limb and say that
mostf aculty are sympathetic to PhD applicants and would like to see everyone
succeed.

Here is a list of the eight places I applied to and the response I got from them:

- Berkeley, US - Admitted
- CISPA, DE - Admitted
- EPFL, CH - Rejected
- IMDEA, ES - Never heard back
- Maryland, US - Rejected
- Max-Planck-Institut (MPI), DE - Admitted
- Purdue, US - Admitted
- Stanford, US - Rejected

# Decisions

To be frank, this was one of the hardest decisions in my life. I was very
happy in my situation at Keytos and did not want to leave. However, the
political situation in the US was very worrying, especially as a Mexican.
It got to the point where my main desire was to leave the country and I made
the decison to do so. This made me rule out all of the schools in the States
as I could not see myself pursuing a PhD in a country where the government is
so adamant on persecuting latinos and non-citizens. I may write more on this
at a later time.

Therefore, the remaining options are the institutes in Germany and working
remotely for Keytos. My rationale then was that if I wanted to leave the
country, I might as well take a leap of faith and give doing research
full-time a solid chance. I told my boss, [Igal](https://www.igal.ceo/), about
my move and he was very understanding.

The decision between MPI-SP and CISPA was also rather hard. MPI seems from the
outside to have more resources for students despite being a smaller institute,
while CISPA had more faculty in a wider range of areas. I ended up going with
CISPA, mostly because it was my top choice from the beginning and because the
institute itself had so many people I'd be happy to work with. Another factor
was that I'd have the mentorship of two researchers whose work I really admire,
Sajin Sasy and Wouter Lueks.

## Half-a-Year into my Decision

So far, I am very happy with my decision. The moment I left the US, a big
worry and stressor has left my chest. There have been a few things I have had
to learn on the fly, namely, German bureaucracy, but I feel very well
supported by CISPA and the people around me.

I have had to bring myself up to speed on privacy enhancing technologies,
which has been fun and frustrating at the same time. I have been covering a
lot of literature that I would have known had I began working in this area in
my undergrad. Moreover, I have also been adjusting to going back to school to
take classes and adjusting to a totally new country and continent. I also like
everyone I've met at CISPA, one of the pros of being such a large center is
that there are so many people to meet!

# Conclusion

PhD applications can feel like a shot in the dark, but talk to your mentors
and other people for advice. The main thing that changed between both cycles
was my personal statement, and the outcome was very different, so don't
underestimate how important each part of the application packet is.

## Postscript

I just recalled while writing this that one of the first things I wanted to
work on with Santiago that was not in software supply-chain security was on
private communication systems. He knew a few people working on an open-source
project on it but nothing really came from it. It's fun recalling this as
one of my advisors at CISPA, Sajin Sasy, works on private communication
systems. It's crazy how the world works sometimes.
