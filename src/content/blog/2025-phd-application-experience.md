With this essay, I hope to share my initial path towards a PhD. If you are
reading this, you are probably an undergraduate student trying to navigate the
rather confusing world of PhD applications. This is my experience applying to
two PhD cycles, how I approached it, what was the outcome, and the decision.

# Background

In order for you, the reader, to understand my experiences through PhD applications,
you will have to have some understanding of my journey that lead me to apply.

# The First Approach

- Bad personal statement -> way too general, rushed, and, upon re-reads, did not
  represent my interests genuinely.
- Maybe a recommendation pool that did not represent my broad experiences.

Applied to many schools

## Failure

- Did not get admitted anywhere
- Was upset as I felt like I did nothing

# The Second Approach

- More focused school list
- My one year experience in the industry helped me understand more what and how I could change
  the world
- Why I tried again

## Results

Applied to mostly the same programs in the USA, with a few more in Europe:

- Berkeley (Admitted)
- CISPA (Admitted)
- EPFL (Rejected)
- IMDEA (Ignored)
- Maryland (Rejected)
- Max-Plank CIS (Admitted)
- Purdue (Admitted)
- Stanford (Rejected)

# Decisions

- Wasn't sure if I wanted to do PhD
  - Was in a very good place
- Uneasiness of current political situation in USA caused me to reconsider
  going to grad school more, and saw the need of more work in public sector
- There was part of me that thought a place like Berkeley would be able to
  protect someone like myself, but I did not think I could do good work while
  constantly worrying about whether or not my background as a Mexican national
  would be used against me. Especially as someone with a close relative whose
  visitor visa was revoked due to how the marriage laws are setup (cannot
  leave the country, but she worked in Mexico). Once I left, I felt an immense
  anxiety lift from my chest. Not sure yet if it was misplaced, especially since
  germany is not too far behind with the likes of AfD rising to prominence.
  Also look at how no american university was able to protect its members
  during the red scare.
- Wanted to work on privacy preserving technologies, made decision given
  current circumstances. Can't make a decision based on future faculty moves
  (Henry corrigan-gibbs to berkeley, Carmela Troncoso to MP-SP).

## Half-a-Year into my Decision

- annoyed at bureaucracy and visa stuff, would've been easier had i been a phd
  visa, but it is whatever honestly
- i have a lot to learn with regards to PETs and crypto
- Really like the people at CISPA and especially the people I interact with
  regularly

# Conclusion

- It can feel like a shot in the dark, main thing that changed between both
  cycles was my personal statement, and rec letter.
  - write something that speaks to what you believe most, this changes over time
  - find the people that can speak of you best, with the most belief in you doing well
